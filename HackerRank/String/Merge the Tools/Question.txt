### [Challenge Name: Merge the Tools!](/challenges/merge-the-tools)


Consider the following:

- A string, $s$, of length $n$ where $s = c_0 c_1 \ldots c_{n - 1}$.
- An integer, $k$, where $k$ is a factor of $n$.

We can split $s$ into $\frac{n}{k}$ subsegments where each subsegment, $t_i$, consists of a contiguous block of $k$ characters in $s$. Then, use each $t_i$ to create string $u_i$ such that:

- The characters in $u_i$ are a subsequence of the characters in $t_i$. 
- Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in $u_i$ occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index $j$ in $t_i$ occurs at a previous index $\lt j$ in $t_i$, then do not include the character in string $u_i$.

Given $s$ and $k$, print $\frac{n}{k}$ lines where each line $i$ denotes string $u_i$.
